This github is a simple matrices multiplication project built in **Golang** to get familiar with the language.

Functionality:
1. The client connects to the server via TCP and sends dimensions of 2 matrices.
2. The server generates 2 random matrices of required dimensions, multiplies them and sends the result matrix back.
